    A keylogger is a type of surveillance software or hardware designed to record and monitor keystrokes made by a user on a computer keyboard, tablet, or smartphone. Keyloggers can capture sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and confidential messages, without the user’s knowledge or consent.

# Types of Keyloggers
# 1.Software Keyloggers:
Description: These are programs installed on a computer to record keystrokes. They are the most common type of keyloggers.
How They Work: Software keyloggers monitor the paths that keystrokes take through the operating system. They can be installed through malicious downloads or phishing attacks.
Transmission: The recorded keystrokes are sent to the attacker via a remote server.
# 2.Hardware Keyloggers:
Description: These are physical devices connected to the computer, usually between the keyboard and the computer.
How They Work: Hardware keyloggers capture keystrokes directly from the keyboard. They require physical access to the device to install.
Transmission: The data is stored on the device and must be retrieved physically by the attacker.

# Keyloggers Work
Recording Keystrokes: Keyloggers record every keystroke made on the device. This includes everything from typing passwords to writing emails.
Data Storage: The recorded data is stored in a file, which can be accessed by the attacker.
Data Transmission: In the case of software keyloggers, the data is often transmitted to the attacker over the internet. Hardware keyloggers require physical retrieval.
